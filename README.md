To my favorite professor Robert Sedgewick from Princeton. I already finished most of it 3 or 4 years ago. 

I believe this is a series that can be reviewed repeatedly, especially after you have worked for some years, and you will have new thoughts on classic algorithms.

The original course is divided into two parts: I and II. I will follow the course outline and attach my 100% passed assignments to each section.
